No changes but check for a pull:

I THINK I MESSED UP AND MADE THE REMOTE  AND LOCAL MASTER CONNECTIONS 
TOO COMPLEX. DELETE THEM, START AGAIN FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS FROM A 
NEW GITHUB FOUNDATION VIDEO.

From my learnC directory on the laptop:

[bob.zavala@medea learnC]: git remote add origin https://github.com/astroJarHead/learnC

[bob.zavala@medea learnC]: git remote
origin
[bob.zavala@medea learnC]: git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/astroJarHead/learnC (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/astroJarHead/learnC (push)

[bob.zavala@medea learnC]: git branch -a
* master	  	       <-- My local one in green
  remotes/origin/main	       <-- My remote one on github.com in red


OK, THIS NOW IS SET TO FETCH AND PUSH TO MY ONLINE REPOSITORY

DO INITIAL FETCH

[bob.zavala@medea learnC]: git fetch -v origin
POST git-upload-pack (404 bytes)

NOTE I CAN SEE STATUS FOR MY LOCAL MASTER AND ORIGIN MASTER 

[bob.zavala@medea learnC]: git status origin
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
[bob.zavala@medea learnC]: git status 
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   git.log
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

NOW I HAVE EDITED AND WILL SAVE THID LOG FILE AND FOLLWOING:
"Git tutorial for Beginners: A Command Line Tutorial" YouTube video by
     Corey Schafer

git diff
git status
git add -A
git status
git commit -v -m "Edit log following Corey Schafer video."
# DON'T FORGET A PULL TO BE SAFE
git pull origin master

ABOVE COMMAND FAILS:

fatal: Couldn't find remote ref master
Unexpected end of command stream

FAILED BECAUSE THE "remote ref master" NEEDS TO BE A VALID REMOTE REFERENCE 
SHOWN IN git branch -a

FOLLOWING DOES WORK BUT PRODUCES ERROR BECAUSE OF LESS TAHN 50% MATCH

[bob.zavala@medea learnC]: git pull origin main
From https://github.com/astroJarHead/learnC
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

I DELETED TE README.md FROM THE github.com/astroJarHead/learnC AND TRIED AGAIN

[bob.zavala@medea learnC]: git pull origin main
From https://github.com/astroJarHead/learnC
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
